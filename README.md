# object_detection
project born of a tv joke hotdog_not_hotdog as was named on my local is an object detection project that evolved since I initially started working on a computer vision + ML + robotics project at college. Initially a research project, the decluttered version detects and identifies fruits. Had to scrape a whole lot of images from the internet :)
